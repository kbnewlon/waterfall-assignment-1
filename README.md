Welcome to my frist README
A short story By: Kayla Newlon

At first I thought this assignment was easy, that was, until I read the directions. 
See I didn't think to read the README. I know, I know, its literally called that. 
Im learning here okay!!

The point of this project is to introduce us students into formatting html and css while also introducing accessability. 

I got all the alt tags and index tabs in to make the website more accessible. 
Then I took out all of the div tags and cleaned up any redundantcies. I followed the w3 schools diagram for semantic elements in HTML. 

In the end, this was a challenge for me. But Im learning to utilize my resources. 

I also feel more and more confident about this everyday. I can't wait to see how I feel in three months.
